# API Schema

See below for details on each of Zapper's API endpoints.
[Swagger docs to test these endpoints can be found here.](https://api.zapper.xyz/api)

## Wallet-specific App and ERC20 Token Balances endpoints

### `v2/balances/apps`

You input wallet addresses and get all the following:

- Detailed breakdown of all app investment positions represented as app tokens owned by the wallet, such as Aave lending positions or Uniswap pools, valued in USD
- Detailed breakdown of all app investment positions represented as contract positions that are not held on the wallet, such ve-locked or farming positions, valued in USD

On Zapper's frontend, all tokens that show up in the *Wallet* section of a portfolio are returned in the [`v2/balances/tokens`](https://docs.zapper.xyz/docs/apis/api-syntax#v2balancestokens) endpoint. All values showing up in the *Apps* section of a portfolio are returned in the `v2/balances/apps` endpoint.

For a list of all supported apps, see [this link](https://zapper.xyz/protocols).

By doing a GET command on this endpoint, you will be returned the cached values Zapper has in its database for the wallets provided. Many wallets already had their balances recently computed by Zapper, and so are sitting in the cache. However, if there is no cached value, the GET response will not contain anything. Cached values for apps are never purged, so could be months or years old. Keep this in mind!

If there is no cached value, or you want Zapper to re-compute the balance so it as fresh as possible, you will need to do a POST command to this endpoint. Once the POST command is received, Zapper will return you a `jobId` value and Zapper will then re-compute the wallet's app balances. You can monitor the status of the re-computation job via [`v2/balances/job-status`](https://docs.zapper.xyz/docs/apis/api-syntax#v2balancesjob-status) by passing in the `jobId` value. Alternatively, you can just wait 10 seconds for the job to finish if you do not want to poll for the job status.

Once the re-calculation job is completed, you can retrieve the newly computed app balances by calling GET `v2/balances/apps`.

Points Cost For `v2/balances/apps` Related Queries:

- 0.25 points per GET `v2/balances/apps` call per wallet included in the call, as this is simply retrieving the value in Zapper's database
- 4 points per POST `v2/balances/apps` call per wallet included in the call. This call triggers Zapper recomputing the wallet's balances, generating a large volume of downstream API calls. A `jobId` will be included in the response
- 0 points per call GET [`v2/balances/job-status`](https://docs.zapper.xyz/docs/apis/api-syntax#v2balancesjob-status), used to monitor the status of the `jobId`. These calls are free, allowing you to poll the status of the computation job

Tips On Using This Endpoint Cost-Effectively:

- If you are querying a wallet for the first time, and it is a potentially popular wallet, there is a chance that a cached value already exists, and you can retry it for only 0.25 points cost. Upon getting the results, you can check how stale the balances are based on the value returned of `updatedAt`
- If you are certain you will want the most up-to-date balances for the wallet, you should call the POST `v2/balances/apps` endpoint first, wait for the job to run after 10s, and then call GET `v2/balances/apps`
- If you are surfacing balances to users in real-time using this call, you can emulate what Zapper's frontend does by first calling GET `v2/balances/apps` to get any cached balances, use these to create a skeleton to display to the user, and then call POST `v2/balances/apps` to then refresh any stale values

Other things to know about this endpoint

- Maximum of 30 RPM (requests per minute)
- Maximum of 15 wallets can be passed into 1 call as parameters. Any more beyond 15 wallets, and the query will fail. And, though we support multiple wallets bundled into 1 call, it's recommended you **query wallets one at a time** for best performance
- Any balance less than $0.01 USD value is not included in the output
- TTL on the data in this endpoint, once computed via a POST request, is infinite. The cached value does not expire. It will only be recomputed when a user requests the accounts balance on Zapper's frontend OR when an API user requests a recomputation

Path

`https://api.zapper.xyz/v2/balances/apps`

Parameters

- `addresses[]`: **Required** | Addresses for which to retrieve balances, inputted as an array. Can handle up to 15 addresses
  - Note: to pass multiple addresses in, the right syntax is `https://api.zapper.xyz/v2/balances/apps?addresses%5B%5D=address_1&addresses%5B%5D=address_2`
- `networks[]`: networks for which to retrieve balances, inputted an array. Available values: ethereum, polygon, optimism, gnosis, binance-smart-chain, fantom, avalanche, arbitrum, celo, moonriver, bitcoin, aurora

Response

- `key`: a unique identifier on the token object that is used to aggregate token balances across multiple addresses. [More details found here](https://docs.zapper.xyz/docs/concepts/app-tokens#what-is-key-why-is-it-useful)
- `addresses`: address the position queried is for
- `appId`: ID of the app
- `AppName`: Display name of app
- `AppImage`: Icon of the app
- `network`: network the app is on
- `updatedAt`: timestamp at which time this wallet's balance for this app was calculated
- `balanceUSD`: value of all positions associated with this app on this network for this wallet, in USD
- `products`: object containing details on all products owned by this wallet
  - `label`: human-readable label of asset group, such as "pools" or "farms"
  - `assets`: object containing all metadata about this group of assets and the positions within the group
    - `tokens`: object containing details about the underlying tokens that comprise this investment positions, such as symbol, wallet, network, balance. A pool token of USDC / DAI would have its underlying tokens reported as USDC and DAI
    - `symbol`: symbol for investment position
    - `decimals`: decimals for position; usually 18 for ERC-20 tokens
    - `supply`: total amount of supply of this position
    - `pricePerShare`: the ratio between the token price and the prices of the underlying tokens. This property is useful for using the balance of the token to determine the exposure to the underlying tokens. [More details and examples found here.](https://docs.zapper.xyz/docs/concepts/app-tokens#what-is-pricepershare-why-is-it-useful)
    - `price`: The price of one unit of this token. In the case of aDAI, the tokens are minted 1:1, so the price is the same as the underlying DAI token.
    - `dataProps`: object containing data used for augmenting the token object with additional data properties. These properties can be used in other places in the application. This would include APY, liquidity in the positions, etc. [More details found here](https://docs.zapper.xyz/docs/concepts/app-tokens#what-are-data-props)
    - `displayProps`: object is used by Zapper Web and Zapper Mobile to render meaningful information to Zapper users about this token. This generally would include labels and decorators. [More details can be found here](https://docs.zapper.xyz/docs/concepts/app-tokens#what-are-display-props)
    - `balance`: balance of investment positioned owned by this wallet. Normalized for decimals
    - `balanceRaw`: raw balance of investment in this position owned by this wallet. This has not been normalized with decimals yet; to get balanceRaw, you'd multiply this value by 10 ^ (decimals) value
    - `balanceUSD`: value of `balance` position, converted to USD
  - `meta`: Information about balances that is not specifically balances. This value is developer defined, but examples are health factors and collateralization ratios (c-ratios)

### `v2/balances/tokens`

You input wallet addresses and get all "base tokens" in the wallet. "Base tokens" are ERC20 tokens that are not invested by the user in an app, but instead sit in the wallet natively. Base tokens are often  liquid and tradable, whereas app tokens are those invested in apps are illiquid and cannot be natively traded, like a Uniswap pool token.

On Zapper's frontend, all tokens that show up in the *Wallet* section of a portfolio are returned in the `v2/balances/tokens` endpoint. All values showing up in the *Apps* section of a portfolio are returned in the [`v2/balances/apps`](https://docs.zapper.xyz/docs/apis/api-syntax#v2balancesapps) endpoint.

Zapper supports over 15,000 base tokens (and counting).

By doing a GET command on this endpoint, you will be returned the cached token balances Zapper has in its database for the wallets provided. Many wallets already had their token balances recently computed by Zapper, and so are sitting in the cache. However, if there is no cached value, the GET response will not contain anything. Cached values are purged after 30 days, as Zapper then considers those balances stale.

If there is no cached value, or you want Zapper to re-compute the token balance so it as fresh as possible, you will need to do a POST command to this endpoint. Once the POST command is received, Zapper will return you a `jobId` value and Zapper will then re-compute the wallet's app balances. You can monitor the status of the re-computation job via [`v2/balances/job-status`](https://docs.zapper.xyz/docs/apis/api-syntax#v2balancesjob-status) by passing in the `jobId` value. Alternatively, you can just wait 10 seconds for the job to finish if you do not want to poll for the job status.

Once the re-calculation job is completed, you can retrieve the newly computed app balances by calling GET `v2/balances/tokens`.

Points Cost For `v2/balances/tokens` Related Queries:

- 0.25 points per GET `v2/balances/tokens` call per wallet included in the call, as this is simply retrieving the value in Zapper's database
- 1 points per POST `v2/balances/tokens` call per wallet included in the call. This call triggers Zapper recomputing the wallet's balances, generating a large volume of downstream API calls. A `jobId` will be included in the response
- 0 points per call GET `v2/balances/job-status?jobId=:jobId`, used to monitor the status of the `jobId`. These calls are free, allowing you to poll the status of the computation job

Tips On Using This Endpoint Cost-Effectively:

- If you are querying a wallet for the first time, and it is a potentially popular wallet, there is a chance that a cached value already exists, and you can retrie it for only 0.25 points cost. Upon getting the results, you can check how stale the balances are based on the value returned of `updatedAt`
- If you are certain you will want the most up-to-date balances for the wallet, you should call the POST [`v2/balances/apps`](https://docs.zapper.xyz/docs/apis/api-syntax#v2balancesapps) endpoint first, wait for the job to run after 10s, and then call GET [`v2/balances/apps`](https://docs.zapper.xyz/docs/apis/api-syntax#v2balancesapps)
- If you are surfacing balances to users in real-time using this call, you can emulate what Zapper's frontend does by first calling GET [`v2/balances/apps`](https://docs.zapper.xyz/docs/apis/api-syntax#v2balancesapps) to get any cached balances, use these to create a skeleton to display to the user, and then call POST [`v2/balances/apps`](https://docs.zapper.xyz/docs/apis/api-syntax#v2balancesapps) to then refresh any stale values

Other things to know about this endpoint:

- Maximum of 30 RPM (requests per minute)
- Maximum of 15 wallets can be passed into 1 call as parameters. Any more beyond 15 wallets, and the query will fail. And, though we support multiple wallets bundled into 1 call, it's recommended you query wallets one at a time for best performance
- Any balance less than $0.01 USD value is not included in the output

Path

`https://api.zapper.xyz/v2/balances/tokens`

Parameters

- `addresses[]`: **Required** | addresses for which to retrieve balances, inputted as an array. Can handle up to 15 addresses
  - Note: to pass multiple addresses in, the right syntax is `https://api.zapper.xyz/v2/balances/tokens?addresses%5B%5D=address_1&addresses%5B%5D=address_2`
- `networks[]`: networks for which to retrieve balances, inputted an array. Available values: ethereum, polygon, optimism, gnosis, binance-smart-chain, fantom, avalanche, arbitrum, celo, moonriver, bitcoin, aurora

Response

- `key`: a unique identifier on the token object that is used to aggregate token balances across multiple addresses. [More details found here](https://docs.zapper.xyz/docs/concepts/app-tokens#what-is-key-why-is-it-useful)
- `address`: address the position queried is for
- `network`: network the app is on
- `updatedAt`: time at which this token balance was calculated. This value should be used to determine if this cached balance is considered too "stale" for your purposes, and thus should be re-calculated via a `POST` command on this endpoint
- `token`:  object containing details about the token, such as metadata, price and balance
  - `id`: internal token id
  - `networkId`: internal network id
  - `address`: token's address on the network
  - `name`: label for token
  - `symbol`: symbol for token

  - `marketCap`: estimated value of all the tradeable tokens
  - `balance`: balance of investment positioned owned by this wallet. Normalized for decimals
  - `balanceRaw`: raw balance of investment in this position owned by this wallet. This has not been normalized with decimals yet; to get balanceRaw, you'd multiply this value by 10 ^ (decimals) value
  - `balanceUSD`: value of `balance` position, converted to USD

### `v2/balances/job-status`

Use this endpoint to poll for the status of a job that is calculating app-related balances or base token balances, via [`v2/balances/apps`](https://docs.zapper.xyz/docs/apis/api-syntax#v2balancesapps) and [`v2/balances/tokens`](https://docs.zapper.xyz/docs/apis/api-syntax#v2balancestokens) respectively.

When you call POST [`v2/balances/apps`](https://docs.zapper.xyz/docs/apis/api-syntax#v2balancesapps) or [`v2/balances/tokens`](https://docs.zapper.xyz/docs/apis/api-syntax#v2balancestokens), a re-calculation of the balances in that wallet is triggered, and the response to those calls will be a value `jobId`. You can then monitor the status of the re-computation job by passing `jobId` as a parameter into this endpoint, `v2/balances/job-status`.

:::info
You are not required to poll for the status of the job via `v2/balances/job-status`; it is just a nice-to-have. Most POST [`v2/balances/apps`](https://docs.zapper.xyz/docs/apis/api-syntax#v2balancesapps) finish computing within 10 seconds and POST [`v2/balances/tokens`](https://docs.zapper.xyz/docs/apis/api-syntax#v2balancestokens) finish within 2 seconds, so you could just insert a delay between your POST and GET commands of that time interval.
:::

- `jobId`: the `jobId` that was passed into the call
- `status`: current status of the computation job
  - `active` = Zapper is currently computing the balance. The results are not ready
  - `completed` = This computation job is complete. You can now call GET `v2/balances/*` to get the result
  - `unknown` = `jobId` that was passed is not in Zapper's system. Could be stale

### `v2/apps/{appSlug}/balances`

You input wallet addresses and get all the following:

- Detailed breakdown of all app investment positions represented as app tokens owned by the wallet, such as Aave lending positions or Uniswap pools, valued in USD
- Detailed breakdown of all app investment positions represented as contract positions that are not held on the wallet, such ve-locked or farming positions, valued in USD

If you query for `appSlug` = `tokens`, you will get all tokens held in the wallet
that are not associated with an App.

Notes on use of the API and limits

- Maximum of 15 wallets can be passed into 1 call, though it's recommended you query wallets one at a time for best performance
- Any balance less than $0.01 USD value is not included in the output

Path

`https://api.zapper.xyz/v2/apps/{appSlug}/balances`

Parameters

- `appSlug`: **(required)** | appSlug of the desired app. This is interchangeable with `appId`, a value used in other queries
- `addresses[]`: **(required)** | addresses for which to retrieve balances, inputted as an array. Can handle up to 15 addresses
- `networks[]`: Networks for which to retrieve balances, inputted an array

Returns

- `appId`: ID of the app. Same as `appSlug`
- `network`: network the app is on
- `groupId`: group this particular investment belongs to within in the app, such as `pool` or `farms`
- `balance`: details on the balance structure, and what kind of balance it is
- `type`: type of position the investment is. `contract-position` is if the investment is held on a 3rd party contract. `app-token` is if the wallet holds tokens in the wallet representing the investment
- `address`: address of token
- `symbol`: symbol of token
- `decimals`: decimals of token
- `supply`: supply of token
- `pricePerShare`: ratio of price to supply of assets
- `tokens`: details on underlying tokens in the investment, such as their address, price, symbol, daily volume, balance, etc
- `displayProps`: details on how to display the asset on Zapper's frontend
- `statsItems`: ancillary stats associated with the investment, such as APY, APR, liquidity, volume, fee, ratio of underlying assets, etc
- `meta`: total value of all positions in the app (example below has 3 different uniswap v2 positions)

## NFT queries

### `v2/nft/balances/net-worth`

Provides the value of all NFTs in a wallet (or bundle of wallets) on the chains that Zapper supports NFTs for (currently Ethereum, Optimism, and Arbitrum)

Path

`https://api.zapper.xyz/v2/nft/balances/net-worth`

Parameters

- `addresses`: **(required)** | input addresses to get net worth for (maximum of 15)

Returns

Estimated net worth in USD of all the wallet's NFTs

cURL

```js
cURL -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.zapper.xyz/v2/nft/balances/net-worth?addresses%5B%5D=0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic sadkfljsdafksal24uh2jk34=='
```

Response

```json
{
  "0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045": "65415.9656178"
}
```

### `v2/nft/user/tokens`

Provides detailed breakdown of all _individual NFTs_ owned in a given wallet, including NFT metadata, collection metadata, estimated value for the NFT, last sale price, rarity, etc.

This endpoint is the right one to query if you want to get **ALL** NFTs in a given wallet. Each page returns 100 NFTs as its maximum number, which is generally enough to capture all NFTs in ~90% of all wallets. If you need to get all NFTs in a wallet that has greater than 100 NFTs, you will need to use the `cursor` to paginate through the list.

This endpoint differs from [`v2/nft/balances/tokens`](https://docs.zapper.xyz/docs/apis/api-syntax#v2nftbalancestokens) in that it does not return an ordered list of NFTs by USD value, and it allows 100 per page versus 25 per page in `v2/nft/balances/tokens`, and this NFT endpoint is much more performant.

Note that Zapper supports NFTs on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism, with plans to support NFTs on additional EVM chains in the future.

Path

`https://api.zapper.xyz/v2/nft/user/tokens`

Parameters

- `userAddress`: **(required)** | Input a single address. This endpoint does not allow an input of an array, unlike other endpoints form Zapper, due to how we index our data for this query.
- `network`: Returns only NFTs from network provided. If not provided, NFTs across all supported chains for NFTs will be returned
- `limit`: Maximum items to return. Limited to 100 maximum. Note that the default value is limit=50
- `cursor`: Cursor used to paginate the results, if more than 100 NFTs are returned in the response

Returns

- `balance`: number of NFTs owned of a given type. If it's ERC_721, it will always be 1. If NFT is ERC_1155, will be a count of how many NFTs are owned by this wallet
- `token`: contains details relating to this NFT, such as price and metadata
  - `id`: internal Zapper ID number for token
  - `name`: name of NFT
  - `tokenId`: ID of token within collection
  - `lastSaleEth`: price of last sale of this NFT
  - `rarityRank`: rank of this NFTs rarity, based on traits, within its collection
  - `estimatedValueEth`: estimated value of this NFT, based on various signals using Zapper's internal model
  - `medias`: link to image for NFT
- `collection`: object containing details about the collection the NFT is in
  - `address`: collection address
  - `network`: network collection is on
  - `name`: name of collection
  - `nftStandard`: standard of the NFT (ERC-1155 or ERC-721)
  - `type`: categorization of the collection
    - `GENERAL`: general NFT collection
    - `BRIDGED`: bridged NFTs from a different chain
    - `BADGE`: badge, POAPs and similar collections
    - `TICKET`: for event ticket or similar collections
    - `ACCOUNT_BOUND`: also known as "soul bound NFTs"; these NFTs are not tradable
    - `WRITING`: writing collections (Mirror, Medium...)
    - `GAMING`: gaming related NFTs
    - `ART_BLOCKS`: Art blocks projects. Multiple collections in one contract
  - `floorPriceEth`: floor price of collection in eth
  - `logoImageURL`: URL for logo of collection
  - `openseaId`: ID of collection on OpenSea

### `v2/nft/balances/tokens`

Provides detailed breakdown of all _individual NFTs_ owned in a given wallet, including NFT metadata, collection metadata, estimated value for the NFT, last sale price, rarity, etc. The values returned in this endpoint are **ORDERED** by descending estimatedUSD value. So, the 25 NFTs returned on the first page will be the 25 highest value NFTs in the wallet's portfolio.

[If you are looking to ingest ALL NFTs held in a given wallet, you should use the endpoint `v2/nft/user/tokens`](https://docs.zapper.xyz/docs/apis/api-syntax#v2nftusertokens) instead.

Note that Zapper supports NFTs on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism, with plans to support NFTs on additional EVM chains in the future.

:::info
The response is paginated, with a maximum number of 25 per response. You will need to parse through different pages, using `cursor` to get values beyond the initial 25 NFT response.

### `v1/api-clients/points`

Endpoint returns how many API points are remaining in your API account. Your balance of API points is funded at the beginning of each month with 10,000 free points or by additional API point purchases.

Notes on how points work

- Your `pointsRemaining` is a simple calculation of: (total points purchased or gifted via free quota that have not expired) - (total points consumed) = points remaining
- If you have multiple API keys issued to you, they all pull points from the same pot; API points are not on a per-key basis, but at a business-entity level. So, all your API keys will return the same `pointsRemaining` value, as they share the same pot of points.
- `pointsRemaining` is calculated and evaluated every ~1 hour. This endpoint is not real-time. Refer to `pointsUpdatedAt` value in response for the timestamp that your points balance was snapshot'd at. It is never more than ~1.5 hour old

Path

`https://api.zapper.xyz/v1/api-clients/points`

Parameters

No parameters; your API key is authorized via your header, so points can only be returned for your API key

Returns

- `pointsRemaining`: how many points your API account has remaining before being turned off due to a negative points balance. Calculation for this is 
- `pointsConsumedYesterday`: how many points your API account consumed yesterday in the full 24 hour period
- `pointsUpdatedAt`: timestamp of when we last snapshot how many points the API account has remaining

cURL

```js
cURL -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.zapper.xyz/v1/api-clients/points' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic sadkfljsdafksal24uh2jk34=='
```

Response

```JSON
{
    "pointsRemaining": "29778",
    "pointsConsumedYesterday": "11",
    "pointsUpdatedAt": "2023-02-28T01:08:01.152Z"
}
```
